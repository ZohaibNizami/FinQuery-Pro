    "# 📊 Finquery_Pro – Financial Data ETL & API System\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Tech Stack\n",
    "- **Backend:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, psycopg2  \n",
    "- **Data Source:** yfinance  \n",
    "- **Database:** PostgreSQL  \n",
    "- **Frontend:** Streamlit  \n",
    "- **Others:** Pydantic, Swagger, Uvicorn\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Completed Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. ⚙️ Database Setup\n",
    "- Established a database connection using `SQLAlchemy` in `database.py`.\n",
    "- Created a DB status check router in `db_status.py`.\n",
    "- Designed four core tables in `models.py`:\n",
    "  - `companies`\n",
    "  - `stock_prices_daily`\n",
    "  - `company_fundamentals`\n",
    "  - `sec_fillings`\n",
    "- Built corresponding Pydantic schemas in `schemas.py`.\n",
    "- Wrote `CREATE TABLE` statements in `schema_core.sql` for migration/reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 📈 ETL Pipeline (`etl_pipeline.py`)\n",
    "- Initialized tickers with `yfinance.Ticker()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ETL Functions Implemented:\n",
    "- `fetch_company_info(ticker)`: Extracts company info like name, sector, industry, and summary.\n",
    "- `fetch_price_history(ticker, period=\"1y\")`: Fetches 1-year historical stock prices.\n",
    "- `load_company_data()`: Loads company info into the `companies` table.\n",
    "- `load_price_data()`: Loads price history into the `stock_prices_daily` table.\n",
    "- `fetch_fundamentals(ticker)`: Fetches financials like income, balance sheet, and cash flow.\n",
    "- `load_fundamentals_data()`: Loads fundamentals into `company_fundamentals`.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ Added `try/except` blocks to handle API call failures.  \n",
    "✔️ Implemented UPSERT to avoid duplication on re-runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. 🧠 API Development with FastAPI\n",
    "- Created API routes in `stocks.py`, wired into `main.py`.\n",
    "- Wrote business logic for all endpoints in `crud.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Router Descriptions:\n",
    "- `POST /etl/company`: Trigger company data fetch and insert.\n",
    "- `POST /etl/price`: Trigger price history fetch and insert.\n",
    "- `POST /fundamentals`: Trigger fundamentals fetch and insert.\n",
    "- `GET /stocks/{ticker}/info_from_db`: Get company info by ticker.\n",
    "- `GET /stocks/{ticker}/prices_from_db`: Get price history by ticker.\n",
    "- `GET /sector/{sector}/info_from_db`: Get company info by sector.\n",
    "- `DELETE /companies/{ticker}`: Delete company by ticker.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🧾 **One-Line Router Summary:**  \n",
    "> FastAPI routes allow ETL execution and full CRUD on financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. 🖥️ Streamlit Frontend Integration\n",
    "- Built frontend interface in `frontend/app.py`.\n",
    "- Connected to FastAPI backend using HTTP requests.\n",
    "- Enabled users to trigger ETL, view data, and interact with the database visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. 🚀 Running the Application\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "streamlit run /home/hanzala/Finquery_Pro/frontend/app.py\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run the API (Swagger):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 Current Status\n",
    "✅ FastAPI backend is working.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ ETL processes successfully fetch and load data.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Database is updated and deduplicated via UPSERTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Streamlit frontend is connected and interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ CRUD operations and all routes fully tested.\n"
